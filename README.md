# RK4 Celestial Body Integrator

This project combines the use of the astropy and numpy libraries as well as the Runge-Kutta method of the 4th order to simulate the orbital patterns of celestial bodies (created by the user of the app). After calculation, the results are stored in the "history" attribute of the Simulation object.
